## Ruhoh is the Universal Static Blog API

<http://ruhoh.com>

### Usage

$ gem install ruhoh     
$ ruhoh help

### Platforms

ruhoh is tested with ruby 1.9.2 on mac OSX Lion.
ruhoh runs in production with ruby 1.9.2 on Ubuntu 10.04.4 LTS.

ruby 1.8.7 will not be (consciously) supported unless enough users bother me about it.

**Windows**

ruhoh should run on Windows with a few considerations:

If you run into trouble with YAML and psych see: https://github.com/ruhoh/ruhoh.rb/issues/54
More help is available here: https://github.com/ruhoh/ruhoh.rb/issues/search?q=windows

I can't easily test ruhoh on a Windows machine, so please consider contributing back to the community for running on Windows.
